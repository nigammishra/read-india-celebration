              <p>It is a journey to experience the process of growth called "READ&gt;THINK&gt;ACT". Reading is the seed for knowledg and innovation. The goal of RIC is to encourage students and citizens of India and the rest of the world to read something new, diverse, and positive for 10 minutes every day. It is an established fact globally that gyan and innovation drive economies and individual success. Reading diverse non-academic books, "self" and "situations" opens up the mind and ignites imagination and awareness. Not reading is not a choice for a person who wants to be successful. Remember, <strong>Gyan (Knowledge + Knowing) and Dhyan are the quintessence of living. NO READING = NO KNOWLEDGE/SUCCESS, AND NO KNOWING = NO INSIGHT / INTELLIGENCE. </strong><i> *Reading 1000 books on swimming will mean nothing until you get in the water. Knowledge alone, without knowing, will drown you! Even the person who has read the most about honey will need to taste it to know it. The power comes from knowing! Knowing is the door to insight and intelligence, and intelligence is the way to self-evolution. </i></p>
              <p>RIC is an endeavour to create value and&nbsp;wealth generators!&nbsp;Come and experience this journey from Reading Books &gt; Reading Self &gt; Knowing Self &gt; Leading Self and Beyond...</p>

              <h4>Reading:</h4>
              <p>Reading is the gateway to transformation. Reading is fun, fashion, and fruition for the mind. Read diverse non-academic books to experience how reading initiates a person into KNOWLEDGE, INDEPENDENT THINKING &amp; KNOWING "SELF".</p>
              <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
              <h5><i>Read, Think, Act is the simplest process for success &amp; wellness:</i></h5>
              <p><i>Read, Think, Act (New &amp; Positive) are the 3 essential factors for reaching one's true potential. Read India Celebration aims to empower the READ, THINK, ACT process in participants.</i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><i>1. <strong>READ (focuses on 3 R's) </strong>i.e. Reading Non-Academic Books, Reading "Self", Reading Situations</i></p>
              <p><i>2. <strong>THINK (Solutions)</strong> focuses on identifying 3 things that can be done for growth &amp; wellness</i></p>
              <p><i>3. <strong>ACT (Intelligently)</strong> focuses on doing/implementing those 3 things on a daily basis</i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><i>The focus of RIC is to put the spotlight on&nbsp;the role of knowledge and independent thinking in the journey called success and the evolution of an individual. At the same time, draw the attention of people to the consequences of not following the READ, THINK, ACT process.</i></p>
              <p>-&gt;Global research &amp; studies tell us that...<strong>"ALL SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE ARE READERS AND INDEPENDENT THINKERS".</strong> ALL SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE TRY 'NEW' THINGS. That means...<strong><i>NOT READING SOMETHING 'NEW' IS FAILURE, NOT THINKING 'NEW' IS FAILURE, NOT DOING SOMETHING 'NEW' IS FAILURE. </i></strong> When a person tries anything 'NEW', there is always some learning, and where there is learning, there cannot be a failure!</p>
              <p><strong><i>Are "Knowledge and Independent Thinking" the essential nutrition and fashion quotients for the being (Body, Mind, Energy + Beyond)?</i></strong></p>
              <p><i>The answer is a big 'YES'. Knowledge and creativity are indeed nutrition and fashion for the whole being not just the mind. The connection between readership, success and leadership is well established, world over. From a known we can get to the unknown, never the other way round. Reading books leads to Reading Self, Reading Self leads to Knowing Self (i.e. knowing our strengths, areas of improvements, happiness (what our heart wants to do) / interests, priorities etc.) and <strong>Knowing 'Self' is the basis to Leading 'Self' &amp; Living Life!!</strong></i></p>
              <p>Human history is the greatest witness to the destruction and violence caused by ignorant people &amp; societies around the world. Unless we understand that our ignorance is our worst enemy, growth complemented by harmony is not possible. <strong>If we do not remember and learn the lessons from our history, the world can never be progressively harmonious. </strong></p>
              <p><i>The consequence of not having knowledge about 'Self' and inability to think independent can be very detrimental to the society and the planet at large. Human greed knows no bounds and under the garb of exploration, exploitation will continue without the knowledge of 'SELF'. Though technological advancements will continue at a rapid pace, conflict and strife will also grow exponentially without independent thinkers. <strong>Remember, ignorant people, ignorant societies and ignorant leaders pose the greatest threat to the well being of the planet. </strong></i></p>
